# Spotify-Top-Tracks-and-Artists

I enjoy seeing my Spotify top artists and tracks of the past 4 weeks, 6 months and All Time using spotipy. I used a website favoritemusicguru but for my top tracks all time, two songs I played while I slept (sounds of falling rain) were still there after years of not playing them. I started to make my own version of the website but ended up discovering spotify only keeps 50 data values, so I'm still unable to see the last 2 songs lol.
